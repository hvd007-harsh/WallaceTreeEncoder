# WallaceTreeEncoder
Wallace tree encoder : Wallace tree encoder is utilized in the process of converting the thermometer code to binary. 
let's discuss about what is wallace tree encoder 
Wallace tree encoder :
Wallace tree encoder is utilized in the process of converting the thermometer code to binary.
This can be termed to be a high speed application and a flash type of flash ADC, which is a 
resistor ladder, encoder and comparator circuit. 

A suitable encoder is required for getting binary code from comparator output. Reducing energy 
of the encoder is vital concern from comparator output. Reducing energy of the encoder is a vital 
concern whereas desging the minimal power flash ADC. 
A suitable encoder is required getting binary encoder is required for getting binary encoder 
is required for getting binary code from comparator circuit. 
Wallace tree encoders diminishes the mistake power flash drive from ADC. Wallace tree encoders diminishes
